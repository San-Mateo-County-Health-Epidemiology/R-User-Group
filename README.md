# R-User-Group

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains markdown files for topics we’ve discussed
during the R user group. Feel free to peruse the index or search for
posts using the GitHub search functionality.

Each topic has two files: a `.qmd` (Quarto) file and a `.md` (markdown)
file. The `.md` file is rendered from the `.qmd` file. If you look
through the `quarto-markdowns` folder you’ll see one of each file for
each topic.

### Upcoming topics

| Date       | Topic                  |
|------------|------------------------|
| 2025-10-16 | new `smcepi` functions |
| 2025-10-30 | special `ggplot2` axes |

### Future topic ideas

If you want to present but don’t have a topic in mind, feel free to do
one of these:

- factors: review what they are, go through basic operations including:
  creating factors, reordering factors and why you might (or might not)
  want to use factors in `ggplot2` and perhaps go over how to deal with
  them in `tidyverse` (`forcats` package) vs base R
- tables in Quarto: go over how to make tables in `kable`, `flextable`
  and `gt`. Compare outputs and when you might or might not want to use
  one (ie if one package can’t render to pdf)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Contribution process:

If you’d like to add your R User Group presentation to this repo, please
follow these steps:

1.  Create a .qmd document (HTML) and manually edit the YAML so it
    follows this outline:

<!-- -->

    ---
    format: gfm
    title: "Title of document"
    author: "Author1_First Author1_last, Author2_first Author2_last, etc."
    date: "YYYY-MM-DD of the R User Group"
    ---

`format: gfm` tells R the output should be a “GitHub Flavored Markdown”.
A GFM is a basic HTML output, so some features (like including tab sets)
aren’t available but it generally meets our needs. Render your `.qmd`
file so it generates an `.md` (markdown) file. This is the “finished”
version.

2.  Once you’ve finished your Quarto doc, render the `.qmd` file and
    push the newly updated `.qmd` and `.md` to GitHub.

3.  Update the table on the `README.Rmd` with your contribution. Fill in
    the date of the R User Group and add a link to your markdown (`.md`)
    file. Documents should be added to the table in reverse
    chronological order (newest at the top). Render the updated
    `README.Rmd` and push the `README.Rmd` and `README.md` files to
    GitHub.

Note: If you want to add images to your Quarto doc, save them in the
`quarto-markdowns/images` folder. Prefix the image name with name of
your .qmd file. Ex: the image for the `intro-to-quarto.qmd` doc is
called `intro-to-quarto_visual-mode.png`.
