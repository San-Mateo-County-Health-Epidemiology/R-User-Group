This repository contains markdown files for topics we've discussed during the R user group. Feel free to peruse the index or search for posts using the GitHub search functionality. 

Each topic has two files: a `.qmd` (Quarto) file and a `.md` (markdown) file. The `.md` file is rendered from the `.qmd` file. If you look through the `quarto-markdowns` folder you'll see one of each file for each topic.
