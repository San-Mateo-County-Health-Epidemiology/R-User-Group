## Overview

There are many ways to import data in your R session. The way you access data largely depends on where the data come from and the options available to you, but whenever you have a choice in how you get data, you should always try to use the most automated method.

Methods:

**Automated direct access to data**  
APIs - allow you to fetch a specific dataset right from the source  
  - ex: `tidycensus` API  
  - ex: API to send data in and out of Box  
			
Drivers to connect to cloud databases  
  - ex: ODBC driver to connect to CDPH's vaccine database in Snowflake  
  - ex: ODBC driver to connect to our data storage in Azure  
			
**Semi-automated access to files instead of data**  
sFTP - secure file transfer protocol  
  - ex: picking up RODS files each morning from folder where ISD drops files from the sFTP  
picking up files from a specific place with a specific naming convention  
  - ex: picking up the newest CalCONNECT download knowing that we download those files once a week  
			
**Manual**  
Using the file name and the `rio` package to import a specific file.   
  
## Automated direct access to data
### APIs

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are a method of sending and receiving data. APIs calls can look different, but broadly all APIs use the same main verbs for sending and receiving data:

- GET: to fetch data  
- POST: to create new data 
- PUT/PATCH: to update existing data
- DELETE: to delete data  

You can read [here](https://blog.postman.com/what-are-http-methods/?_gl=1*ahg91n*_gcl_au*MTM4OTg1NDE3Ni4xNzI3NzM4Nzky*_ga*MTQ0MDY1ODA0MS4xNzI3NzM4Nzky*_ga_CX7P9K6W67*MTczMDM4OTM5MC4yLjAuMTczMDM4OTM5MC42MC4wLjA.) for more details.

We typically use the GET command when working with APIs as we are typically pulling data in instead of creating or updating existing data. 

When you fetch data from an API, it usually comes in a .csv (comma separated) or JSON (JavaScript object notation) format. A .csv will feel familiar, but JSON.
