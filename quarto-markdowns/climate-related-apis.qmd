## National Weather Service (NWS) API

### Overview

The [National Weather Service (NWS) API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) allows users to access current and forecast weather data (maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity, probability of precipitation, windspeed and wind direction), and alerts (watches/warnings/advisories for various weather hazards). Further documentation for using the API can be found [here](https://weather-gov.github.io/api/general-faqs).

Weather data for a point location can be retrieved by indicating the location coordinates in the URL up to a maximum of four decimal places. As the United States is within the northern and western hemispheres, latitude is a positive value and longitude is a negative value, respectively.

No key/token is required for this API. Data is received as a JSON object of nested tables which can be parsed using the `jsonlite` package.

### Using the API

Using the example of Redwood City in San Mateo County, CA:

```{r}
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

# pull JSON object of nested tables for specified location 
location_rwc <- httr::GET(url = "https://api.weather.gov/points/37.4848,-122.2281") 
# pull URL for location forecast (gridpoints for NWS forecast office)
forecast_url_rwc <- jsonlite::fromJSON(rawToChar(location_rwc$content))$properties$forecast
# pull JSON object of nested tables for forecast of specified location
forecast_rwc <- GET(forecast_url_rwc)
# pull data into a dataframe
data_rwc <- fromJSON(rawToChar(forecast_rwc$content))$properties$periods 

glimpse(data_rwc)
```

Note the data needs further cleaning. For example, there is no clearly identifiable date variable.

### Example Data Cleaning

```{r}
data_rwc1 <- data_rwc %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(start_time), 
         max_temp_f = case_when(is_daytime == TRUE ~ temperature)) %>% 
  filter(is_daytime == TRUE) %>% 
  select(date, max_temp_f, probability_of_precipitation, wind_speed, wind_direction, short_forecast, detailed_forecast)


data_rwc2 <- data_rwc %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(start_time),
         min_temp_f = case_when(is_daytime == FALSE ~ temperature)) %>% 
  filter(is_daytime == FALSE) %>% 
  select(date, min_temp_f)

data_rwc <- left_join(data_rwc1, 
                      data_rwc2, 
                      by = "date") %>% 
  select(date, max_temp_f, min_temp_f, everything()) 

glimpse(data_rwc)
```

## HeatRisk API

### Overview

HeatRisk is a heat and health data-based index that provides current and forecast heat risk developed jointly by NWS and Centers for Disease Control (CDC). HeatRisk is available via [NWS](https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/heatrisk/) or [CDC's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network Data Explorer](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/DataExplorer/). The level of risk is represented by a colour and number and the tool identifies groups potentially most at risk at the indicated level. While HeatRisk cannot be accessed by API via the NWS site, it can via the CDC site. Further documentation for using the API can be found [here](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/apihelp).

The API URL can be accessed by creating a query via the Data Explorer site linked above. Use the following parameters: **Heat & Heat-related Illness (HRI)** \> **HeatRisk** \> **HeatRisk Forecast**. Continue modifying the query for your purposes (geography type, geography, time). Once the query runs, click the **Share** button to get the API URL.

While no key/token is required for this API, having a token is recommended for a faster data feed and to overcome limitations. A token request can be made by emailing nephtrackingsupport\@cdc.gov. Data is received as a JSON object of nested tables which can be parsed using the `jsonlite` package.

### Using the API

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

# pull JSON object of nested tables for forecast of location specified in URL
hr_forecast <- httr::GET("url") 
# find data and pull into a dataframe
hr_data <-jsonlite::fromJSON(httr::content(hr_forecast, "text", encoding = "UTF-8"), flatten = TRUE)
hr_data <- hr_data$tableResult  
```

When using the example of a census tract in Redwood City in San Mateo County, CA, this is what results:
*Note: showing the code for this example as there is additional code from the format above*

```{r}
#| include: false
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
# define the timeframe to embed into URL (this is useful for automation)
hr_forecast_dates_rwc <- format(seq.Date(Sys.Date(), by = "day", length.out = 7), "%Y%m%d") 
# update URL to embed timeframe
hr_forecast_url_rwc <- paste0("https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/apigateway/api/v1/getCoreHolder/1457/137/1/6/8/", paste(hr_forecast_dates_rwc, collapse = ","), "/0/0")

hr_forecast_rwc <- httr::GET(hr_forecast_url_rwc)
hr_data_rwc <-jsonlite::fromJSON(httr::content(hr_forecast_rwc, "text", encoding = "UTF-8"), flatten = TRUE)
hr_data_rwc <- hr_data_rwc$tableResult 

hr_data_rwc <- hr_data_rwc %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(geo_id == "06081610202")

glimpse(hr_data_rwc)
```

Note the data is pretty messy - not in chronological order and unnecessary variables - and needs to be cleaned.

### Example Data Cleaning

```{r}
hr_data_rwc <- hr_data_rwc %>% 
  select(!category_name) %>% 
  rename(category_number = category_id,
         category_name = category) %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(temporal)) %>% 
  arrange(date) %>% 
  select(date, geo, geo_id, category_number, category_name)

glimpse(hr_data_rwc)
```
