## Background

Root directories for R Markdown and Quarto files work a bit differently than other R files and can cause a lot of headaches. 

By default your working directory for your R Markdown or Quarto document should be the directory where your markdown is saved. You can check or change this here: **Tools > Global Options > R Markdown**:

This [chapter](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/working-directory.html) goes into more detail about options for setting your R Markdown or Quarto working directory and some pros and cons for each option. 

## In practice

We should use the default **document** setting so that documents run consistently on all of our computers. 

Using the **document** setting raises an issue - what if you have an R Markdown or Quarto document in a sub-directory and you're fetching data from somewhere else?

### Project based workflows

If you're working within a project, you should consider the [`here`](https://here.r-lib.org/) package. It allows you to easily find files from other directories within your project.

This [vignette](https://here.r-lib.org/articles/rmarkdown.html) explains exactly how it works in R Markdown. If you want to test it out, create a new R Markdown or Quarto file and run:

```
here::here()
```

And then run:

```
getwd()

```

And you'll see that `here::here()` returns the project directory while `getwd()` returns your document directory. 

### Non-project based workflows 

If you're working in a non-project workflow, you likely need to specify full paths to fetch your data. 

You can use `setwd()` to fetch data, but that will only work in the chunk you run it in. This isn't a problem if you load all of your data at once but if you load data throughout, you might consider using this in your setup chunk:

```
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '<dir goes here>')

```
