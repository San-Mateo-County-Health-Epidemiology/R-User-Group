## Overview

Think of Quarto as the new version of R Markdown. It has all the functionality of R Markdown plus some really cool upgrades.

We aren't going to ask you to convert your R Markdown files into Quarto files, but when you go to create new R Markdown files, you should consider using Quarto. Posit will continue supporting R Markdown but will focus on adding new features to Quarto.

Note: Quarto should be included in your R Studio installation - you don't need to install it separately.

Full details about Quarto live [here](https://quarto.org/).

## Some important changes/improvements:

### Visual mode

This is also an option in R Markdown, so it's not a reason to switch to Quarto, but it's a really cool feature! In the upper left corner of your Quarto doc, you can switch between **Source** and **Visual** modes.

**Source** mode is what you're probably used to from using R Markdown. **Visual** mode offers a preview of your document and has a toolbar to help you with formatting text, inserting images and adding links. If you bold text in the **Visual** mode, then you'll see the edited source text in the **Source** mode.

### Typst vs LaTeX for PDFs

When you knit an R Markdown file to PDF, you typically have to use a LaTeX distribution like MikTeX or tinytex. These tend to be finnicky and difficult to use.

Posit has introduced **typst** as an alternative to LaTeX for rendering to PDF from Quarto. It promises to be easier to use than LaTeX! Full details are [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst.html)

### Code evaluation options

In R Markdown, we can decide to run a code chunk, display code, warnings and messages using the little gear in the upper right corner of the code chunk.

In Quarto, these options are denoted in either the YAML at the top or using a `#|` in the top of a code chunk. In the YAML, you specify the default behavior for the document. Here the default would be that none of the code in the document is actually run:

```{r}
#| eval: false
---
title: "My Document"
execute:
  echo: false
---
```

If you want to override the default behavior for a given code chunk, you can add the options you want to the top of the code chunk using this syntax: `#| eval: false`. 

A full list of options lives [here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html).


### Other benefits

Quarto works with Python, Julia and a bunch of other languages. Since we primarily use R, this isn't a huge deal to us, but it's great in the event any of us branch out!

You can also make presentations from Quarto. I made one and it lives [here](https://github.com/San-Mateo-County-Health-Epidemiology/redcap_apis_and_r).
