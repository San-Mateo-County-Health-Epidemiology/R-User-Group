## Overview

Sometimes you need to save data for downstream analyses or to load into a different data visualization tool like Power BI. This goes through how to save those data and also considerations about what should be (or not be) in those files. 

## Structure

If you are saving data that you'll use in a separate R process or in a Power BI report, there are two good ways to save your data:

1. Save over a "main" file and then save copies of your data to an archive. When you do this, you can set your reports to look to the "main" file. 

```
main_folder
│   data.csv    
│
└───archive
│   │   data_20250101.csv
│   │   data_20250108.csv
│   │   data_20250115.csv
│   │   data_20250122.csv
│   │   ...

```

2. Save the file with the date appended and have a folder of dated files. When you do this, you need to include logic in your R file or script to pull the newest file each time. 

```
main_folder
│
└───data
│   │   data_20250101.csv
│   │   data_20250108.csv
│   │   data_20250115.csv
│   │   data_20250122.csv
│   │   ...

```
